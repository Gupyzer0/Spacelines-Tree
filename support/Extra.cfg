	@description = Spacecraft entering the atmosphere at orbital velocities are predicted to experience incredibly extreme temperatures, which may pose a problem when we try and get our probes, and eventually crews, back. We've designed this sturdy probe, loaded with all kinds of sensors, to help our engineers understand just what a spacecraft goes through during re-entry. Just make sure to drop it over a unoccupied area!
