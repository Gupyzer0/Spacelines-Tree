# Spacelines Tree

When I started KSP, I immediately went out looking for any mod that had realistic parts, specifically something that included Agena or Thor, and ended up finding the Bluedog Design Bureau "BDB" set of parts. Instantly I could feel that this mod required another type of tech tree, so it was just a matter of time for me to find the Skyhawk Science System "SSS" made for BDB as a "probes before crew" start.

After some time, I noticed that the SSS wasn't updated to the latest release of BDB, so I learned some MM, and voila! Here's the **Spacelines Tree**.

So, yes! The Spacelines Tree is a fork of CessnaSkyhawk's Skyhawk Science System but with some modifications to the available nodes, like including a balloon tank line of nodes for all of your Atlas/Centaur needs.

Just like the SSS the objective of this tree is to give you a progression from sounding rockets to the latest technologies.
